  <h1>Hello, my name is Braden</h1>
  <p>A few things about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Before Codeworks, I graduated high school last spring</li>
    <li>I hope to get a better understanding of coding and how it works, so that I can build a career out of it</li>
    <li>I'm a fast learner, except for when I'm not</li>
    <li>I also tend to be a slow thinker, but there are exceptions</li>
    <li>I've always wanted to have some kind of career involving coding</li>
  </ul>
